## About Me
Hi there! My name is **Jackie Sun** and I enjoy embroidering, reading, cooking, running, climbing, listening to podcasts, keeping my plants alive, exploring my city, and impulsively purchasing flowers.

I recently graduated from [Rutgers University - New Brunswick](https://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/) with degrees in computer science and cognitive science and I'm currently working as a Government and Public Services Business Analyst for [Deloitte Consulting](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/services/consulting-deloitte.html) in the DMV area.

I recently moved to Washington, DC and I've been using this as an opportunity to start fresh and grow myself into a better person with each passing day.

### Things I've Accomplished:
- Learned to enjoy exploring the city alone (museums, restaurants, parks)
- Made some cool friends
- Developed a running routine (aiming for my first 5K on 3/26!)

### Things I'm Working On:
- Getting into lifting / strength-training
- Exploring data analysis/data analysis/statistics/surveying and growing my portfolio
- Saying "no" more often
- Getting back into reading
